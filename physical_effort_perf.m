%
% F_threshold: threshold of force (% of MVC) to maintain
%
% F_tolerance: percentage of MVC tolerance we accept around the threshold
%
% time_limit:
% (false): no time limit = keep doing until performance reached

%
% timings: structure with relevant timings for the task (pause timing, time
% to wait for the effort performance, etc.)
%
% R_or_P: 'R' reward or 'P' punishment trial (if not empty will display the
% monetary amount on the screen)

%   .taskType: task type (0: odd/even; 1: lower/higher than 5)
%   .totalTime_success: time passed between trial onset and last correct
%   answer (if the trial was a success), NaN if trial was a failure
